## .ezsh
Custom ZSH functions for ease of life

## Overview
This repository provides handy ZSH commands along with a ZSH script loader that dynamically loads ZSH functions, aliases, and environment variables from organized directories. 

It allows users to define functions and commands in a nested directory structure, automatically prefixes function names based on their directory paths, and ensures sourcing of both function scripts and other shell configuration files.
